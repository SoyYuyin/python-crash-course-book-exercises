In Python you can:
- Create and work with lists
- Use "if" statements to control the flow on your programs by doing 
different things depending on different conditions 
- Let the user input data to use in on your programs
- Use for and while loops to iterate over iterables like list and dictionaries
- Create functions to reutilize code.
  - Functions can optionally take parameters and return something
  - Functions can take positional and keyword arguments.
  - We can set default values on parameters in case none are provided
- Modularize you code by creating modules
  - Modules are python files (.py) containing some code that can be imported
    by other programs
  - There are different syntactic ways to import modules, it's recommended to be
    specific and not avoid importing using "from module_name import *" to avoid
    ambiguity and naming collisions.
- Create classes to further organize code and create many instances of a class
  from a defined class.
  - Classes can hold variables known as attributes and also functions known as 
    methods
  - We can create other related classes by inheriting the properties of an 
    existing class. 
  - Classes can be imported as well to keep code organized.
- Create and read text.txt files to store and retrieve information
  - Use "with open(filename) as file_object:" to safely open and close files
  - Read entire file using file_object.read() method
  - Read file by looping line by line using "for line in file_object"
  - Make a list of lines from a file sing "file_object.readlines()"
